### 문제 설명

<p>Searching for the very best grass, the cows are travelling about the pasture which is represented as a grid with N rows and M columns (2 <= N <= 100; 2 <= M <= 100). Keen observer Farmer John has recorded Bessie's position as (R1, C1) at a certain time and then as (R2, C2) exactly T (0 < T <= 15) seconds later. He's not sure if she passed through (R2, C2) before T seconds, but he knows she is there at time T.</p>

<p>FJ wants a program that uses this information to calculate an integer S that is the number of ways a cow can go from (R1, C1) to (R2, C2) exactly in T seconds. Every second, a cow can travel from any position to a vertically or horizontally neighboring position in the pasture each second (no resting for the cows). Of course, the pasture has trees through which no cow can travel.</p>

<p>Given a map with '.'s for open pasture space and '*' for trees, calculate the number of possible ways to travel from (R1, C1) to (R2, C2) in T seconds.</p>

### 입력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: Three space-separated integers: N, M, and T</li>
	<li>Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes row i of the pasture with exactly M characters that are each '.' or '*'</li>
	<li>Line N+2: Four space-separated integers: R1, C1, R2, and C2.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

### 출력 

 <p>Line 1: A single line with the integer S described above.</p>
