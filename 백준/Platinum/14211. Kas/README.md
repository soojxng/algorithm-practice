### 문제 설명

<p>Kile and Pogi have found N banknotes on the street. After making sure that the original owner is nowhere to be found, they decided to split the banknotes amongst themselves. In the end they want to “win” the same amount of money so they split the banknotes in such a way. Of course, the sum of the banknotes nobody ends up having is the least possible ​one.</p>

<p>Since they couldn’t just leave the remaining banknotes on the street, they decided to go to a nearby casino and put everything on red​, hoping that they would end up getting twice the money they bet. The roulette decided on the (lucky, for this time) number 13 and our heroe s decided to split the money they won. The payout is such that Kile and Pogi will always be able to split the money they won into two equal parts.</p>

<p>Because of the immense adrenaline rush, the boys have lost their mathematical abilities. Help them figure out how much money each of them is taking home. </p>
